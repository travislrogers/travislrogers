Hi, I'm Travis Rogers, I'm a visual designer using a variety of tools to explore the intersection of art, technology and culture.
I'm currently learning Houdini, Python, blockchain technology, philosophy and music. I'm looking to collborate on artistic projects focused on exploring NFTs as a medium.
